'It was exciting to start the course as I am very curious. My background isnt that technical, so it will be a tough course for me. Nevertheless I am highly motivated. I find both books really good and well structured. I am still learning how to find supporting material for writing R markdown. I was not able to digest all information, so I will need to come back to the chapters.'

'For the beginning, the clinic I visited on Thursday and the help I received was excellent. However I would suggest tutoring groups for inexperienced students to get a bit more informal support along the course and to reduce the burden from the teaching and tutoring team.'

'I played around with the exercises. I encountered also some challenges such as not being able to limit the countries to Europe only. So, there is a looot to do and learn.'


'This is a good start :)'

'Here are the links to my github: https://github.com/elinakuu/IODS-project/ and https://elinakuu.github.io/IODS-project/ but the diary is not working so you find it under the first link if I dont get it work.'
